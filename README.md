# Mobile-Project
What I have developed here is a basic Inventory application that is meant to manage warehouse inventory. Within the application we have a login screen, a screen that displays all times within the database and also an alerts page. When designing the application, I tried to keep the users in mind from the very beginning. Here I have tried to make an application that will allow for the automation of inventory rotation and management. I believe that what I have created is very intuitive and simple to use. This application will allow anyone who wants to use it to integrate it with their warehouse very easily. When developing the application, I tried to refer to the Android Best Practices guidelines so that the design would be consistent with other apps our users already use.
